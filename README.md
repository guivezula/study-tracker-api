# Study Tracker API

A small backend project focused on learning API architecture and modern tooling.  
The goal is to build a clean and scalable API that exposes the same domain model through both **REST** and **GraphQL**, using **Node.js**, **Express** and **Prisma ORM**.

## 📌 Objectives

- Build a REST API and a GraphQL API over the same data source
- Apply backend best practices
- Design a clean project structure
- Integrate a real database using Prisma ORM
- Practice database migrations and versioning
- Prepare for public deployment

## 🛠 Tech Stack (planned)

- Node.js
- Express
- REST API
- GraphQL
- Prisma ORM
- SQLite (development)
- TypeScript *(optional)*

## 🚧 Project Status

- REST **Users API** is complete and documented.  
- REST endpoints for **Courses** and **Enrollments** are planned.  
- GraphQL layer is not yet implemented — will be added after REST is finalized.

## 🗂 Planned Features (initial)

- Users
- Courses
- Enrollments
- Progress tracking
- REST endpoints
